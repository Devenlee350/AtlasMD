- You can add multiple mods by separating their numbers with `,` like: `918101187835,923045204414` etc. where `91` is country code and `8101187835` is phone number. ( Do not use international format like: `+91 8101187835` or `+918101187835` etc. And also do not use `0` before country code like: `0918101187835` etc.)
